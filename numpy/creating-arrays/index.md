# Creating Numpy Arrays

Numpy's basic data structure is called `ndarray`. This is basically n-dimensional array.

There are four main ways to create Numpy arrays.

1. Create Numpy array using Python sequences.
2. Using Numpy array creation objects such as `arange`, `ones`, `zeros`, etc.
3. Use Special package functions like `random` to create `ndarray`.
4. Create array by loading data from files.

## 1. Array using Python sequences

You can easily construct `ndarray` using `array` functino defined in the `numpy` by passing any Python list.
